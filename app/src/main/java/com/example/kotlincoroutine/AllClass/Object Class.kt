/* In Kotlin, an object is a special construct used to define a singletonâ€”a class that has only one instance throughout the application.
The object keyword is used to declare a class and create its single instance at the same time.
This is useful when you need a class that should have exactly one instance, such as for managing shared resources, configuration, or utility functions.
